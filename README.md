## My process

This is a very simple use of HTML and CSS with flex-box styling as the base. I have been working on building sites from a mobile-first prospective and then using media queries for larger screens and desktop styling.

In this example, I have maintained the mobile styling up to 670px and then maintained the main card container with a max-width of 750px.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have focused on trying to utilise the Don'tRepeatYourself (DRY) method with this code. Focusing on utilising the common HTML tags such as `<h1>` and `<p>` to make key changes.

I have also used the original svg tags for the icons rather than encasing within a image tag to remove unnecessary tags.

As such class names were primarily used so for either sizing, colorways or interactive elements of the cards.

### Continued development

Going forward, if it possible to refactor some of the css code and include any accessibility to the cards. I would also like to colorways and design factors.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell's Conquering Responsive Layouts Course](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/conquering-responsive-layouts) - This helped me understand mobile-first design and css interactions. It has been a fun 30-day course with practical examples and hands-on experiences.
